# Welcome to arev-dev-lab 👨‍💻

This GitHub organization is a dedicated space for my learning projects, university coursework, tutorials, and technical experiments.

Here you'll find:
- 🔹 Course assignments and labs
- 🔹 Practice code in Python, Java, and C++
- 🔹 Cloud projects (AWS, Docker, etc.)
- 🔹 Sandboxes for trying new technologies

## Why arev-dev-lab?

Keeping my learning separate from my personal GitHub profile helps me:
- Stay organized
- Track my growth over time
- Experiment freely without cluttering my portfolio
